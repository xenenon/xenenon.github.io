Welcome to my website. This is my personal blog/indiewebsite/presence for myself on the web. I want to write about all sorts of things and have this website be a personal record for me that anyone is welcome to benefit from and enjoy.

My name is Jeremy Palmer and I am a cybersecurity undergrad. I am half way done with my degree and plan on getting multiple different certifications. I currently hold the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity cert. I like to travel and experience different cultures and food.
