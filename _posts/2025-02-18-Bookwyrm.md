# Bookwyrm a Fediverse Goodreads Alternative

I want to start this with a little bit of background. I have been becoming very interested in removing big tech from my life other than Apple in major ways especially when it comes to social media. I don't really like Meta products and never get on my Facebook then comes along the enshittification of other platforms like X formally known as Twitter and Reddit now is a great time to flock to other social instances or having a blog the one you are reading right now. I have in the past year been dabbling in different fediversal websites including the og Mastodon, Lemmy/kbin, and Pixelfed. I have links to all of my accounts on my /about page for anyone who wants to connect. I have learned much about the fediverse from [Shellsharks](https://shellsharks.com/notes/2025/01/10/welcome-to-the-fediverse#title) and have found some great content to follow and enrich my fediversal experience. This has lead me this year to come across a little gem that I have not seen get much notice or mention on the web and that gem is Bookwyrm. Bookwyrm is a Goodreads alternative for people who want to track the books they read, share reviews and connect with other readers. You can search for books to add to different lists as well as import csv files from other services like Goodreads. I still have a Goodreads account but I like having a fediverse backup and community to share with.
