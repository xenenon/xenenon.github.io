# Looking Ahead to 2025: A Roadmap of Sorts

I wanted to state some sort of a plan for my site this year and give myself some [SMART](#SMART) goals to try and accomplish both for the site and in life. I'm hoping this can be a fun way to start the year off positively and then next year look back and see if I accomplished what I wanted or if I made unrealistic goals. Not all of the goals will be SMART goals.

## [SMART](SMART) Goals

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-bound

1. Craft at least 1 blog post a month (I plan on having another one out on Friday for Data Privacy Week)
2. Pass the Network + Exam by Fall
3. Maintain my GPA in School
4. Start Hacking the Box
5. Work on my overall fitness and health more
6. Be the best father I can be
