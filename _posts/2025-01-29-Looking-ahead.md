# 2025: A Roadmap of Sorts

I wanted to state some sort of a plan for my site this year and give myself some SMART goals to try and accomplish both for the site and in life. I'm hoping this can be a fun way to start the year off positively and then next year look back and see if I accomplished what I wanted or if I made unrealistic goals. Not all of the goals will be SMART goals because some I want to be longer term and I feel SMART Goals work best for a shorter term.

## SMART

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-bound

## 2025 Goals

- Craft at least 1 blog post a month (I plan on having another one out on Friday for Data Privacy Week)
- Pass the Network + Exam by Fall
- Maintain my GPA in School
- Start Hacking the Box
- Work on my overall fitness and health more including diet
- Be the best father I can be 
- Read at least 25 books by the end of the year
- Work on interesting python coding projects
